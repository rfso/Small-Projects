#  :package: Small Projects (Still under construction)

## üîç Full Access:

You can access the main (and single) page here: https://rfso.github.io/Small-Projects/

##  üìå About

The main idea behind the creation of this 'repo' is to showcase in a single place all my small projects. Also, I think it will be easier for people to navigate between all the projects (and their respective code) and to preview them.

## :gear: How This Works:

Opening this link (https://rfso.github.io/Small-Projects/) you'll gain access to a single page where all projects will be shown. Each project has its own page link, also you can check the details and the code behind the project by clicking on the second link.

## üíª  Tools/Technologies:

I'll be constantly updating this section as soon as I add a new technology to any uploaded project. For now, I'm utilizing:
-   HTML5;
-   CSS3;
-   Javascript.


## :wrench: Things that still needs to be done:
- Fix the responsive/mobile version;
- Add my own projects (the images currently added are just placeholders).
